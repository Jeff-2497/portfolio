                    <h3>An Overview</h3>
                    <p>
                        With the many website builders available to business owners today, many small businesses are increasingly establishing their online presence, 
                        yet having these tools doesn’t guarantee a site is accessible, usable, and aligns with customer needs. When a friend referred me to work with 
                        one of my local area’s restaurants, I knew I could design and develop a website that would meet their expectations as well as their users.  
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Through secondary and user research, I created a design that encompassed <span class="emphasize">clarity</span> and 
                        <span class="emphasize">mobile responsiveness</span> so customers could get the information they needed without frustration.

                Even with access to modern website builders, small businesses still struggle to create a user-friendly website. This leaves customers 
                unable to find critical information, confused by navigation, or experiencing a poor mobile experience.

                I analyzed 5 websites I found most relevant to the type of site I'm trying to design
                and found that each provided its strong and weak points, but the common theme was having
                more simple/minimal layouts. Thus thus allows their customers to easily find the critical 
                features that they are looking for.

                After considering my prior research and completing an affinity map, I concluded that to provide Olivia's Noodle House with a proper website that will foster 
                the <span class="emphasize">best brand image</span>, while <span class="emphasize">retaining customer engagement</span>, I will need to focus on a more <span class="emphasize">simplistic yet concise</span> site design. This would clearly highlight all

                Combining my research findings, inspiration from other websites, and my personal design preferences, I developed an initial set of wireframes for a typical restaurant 
                site layout. In this design, I <span class="emphasize">emphasized the restaurant’s location and hours</span> by placing them directly below the hero image. Additionally, 
                I included a <span class="emphasize">Yelp review section</span> to build trust with site visitors.

            <p class="p1-padding">
                After coming back and re-evaluating my wireframes after a week, I decided to make some major changes to make the site more unique, memorable, and usable. These changes aimed to improve usability while giving the site a distinctive visual identity.

                    <ul>
                        <li>This navigation section was a lot more visually appealing and provided more value than the location/hours information (realized this information is easily found on restaurants’ Google Business pages, so no need to highlight them on the homepage)</li>
                        <li>In addition to providing more usability, it shows off related imagery, which gives users a better sense of the restaurant experience</li>

            <h4 class="h4-headers">CONCLUSION + LESSIONS LEARNED</h4>
            <h3>Opportunities for improvement</h3>
            <p class="p1-padding">
                With this project, it was a chance for me to test how well I could apply my prior learning to designing/building 
                a website from scratch. I think I did well and found the whole learning process, from UX research and design 
                to development and implementation, to be extremely valuable in shaping me into a more well-rounded designer.
            </p>

            <h4>Success metrics</h4>
            <p>
                Due to this being a fresh website and not a redesgin, I don't have prior data for comparison. Here are 
                some metrics I will be intermediatly tracking to see how the site is preforming.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><span>Task Completion Rate:</span> Measures how many users successfully complete key actions on the site, like finding product info or going to the order page.</li>
                <li><span>Average Session Duration:</span> Shows how long users are spending on the site, demonstrating engagement with the content.</li>
                <li><span>Bounce Rate:</span> Tracks the percentage of visitors who leave after viewing only one page, helping identify navigation or usability issues.</li>
                <li><span>Click-through on Key CTAs:</span> Measures how often users interact with important calls-to-action, like "Order Now" or "Menu." This thus showing the effectiveness of site design in guiding users.</li>            
            </ul>

            <h4>Lessons learned</h4>
            <ol>
                <li><span>Tool selection matters.</span> After initially viewing this project as an opportunity to learn how to use a website block builder (WordPress), I realized, after spending around 10 hrs learning and designing with the software, that it was slowing me down. Switching to coding the website directly allowed me to leverage my existing skills and complete the project more efficiently.</li>
                <li><span>Don’t underestimate small usability tests.</span> Quick feedback from a few friends or my instructors revealed usability and design issues I hadn’t noticed. This reinforced how valuable small-scale testing can be for catching overlooked problems.</li>
                <li><span>Managing time across multiple roles.</span> Conducting research, designing, and developing a website has taught me the importance of setting realistic goals. Moreover, breaking a project into smaller milestones allowed me to present tangible deliverables to the client, enabling them to be consulted throughout the project's progression.</li>
            </ol>
