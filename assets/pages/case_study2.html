                    <h3>An Overview</h3>
                    <p>
                        With the many website builders available to business owners today, many small businesses are increasingly establishing their online presence, 
                        yet having these tools doesn’t guarantee a site is accessible, usable, and aligns with customer needs. When a friend referred me to work with 
                        one of my local area’s restaurants, I knew I could design and develop a website that would meet their expectations as well as their users.  
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Through secondary and user research, I created a design that encompassed <span class="emphasize">clarity</span> and 
                        <span class="emphasize">mobile responsiveness</span> so customers could get the information they needed without frustration.

                Even with access to modern website builders, small businesses still struggle to create a user-friendly website. This leaves customers 
                unable to find critical information, confused by navigation, or experiencing a poor mobile experience.

                I analyzed 5 websites I found most relevant to the type of site I'm trying to design
                and found that each provided its strong and weak points, but the common theme was having
                more simple/minimal layouts. Thus thus allows their customers to easily find the critical 
                features that they are looking for.

                After considering my prior research and completing an affinity map, I concluded that to provide Olivia's Noodle House with a proper website that will foster 
                the <span class="emphasize">best brand image</span>, while <span class="emphasize">retaining customer engagement</span>, I will need to focus on a more <span class="emphasize">simplistic yet concise</span> site design. This would clearly highlight all 
                the important features that a restaurant site needs to provide a great user experience.

                Combining my research findings, inspiration from other websites, and my personal design preferences, I developed an initial set of wireframes for a typical restaurant 
                site layout. In this design, I <span class="emphasize">emphasized the restaurant’s location and hours</span> by placing them directly below the hero image. Additionally, 
                I included a <span class="emphasize">Yelp review section</span> to build trust with site visitors.

            <p class="p1-padding">
                After coming back and re-evaluating my wireframes after a week, I decided to make some major changes to make the site more unique, memorable, and usable. These changes aimed to improve usability while giving the site a distinctive visual identity.

                    <ul>
                        <li>This navigation section was a lot more visually appealing and provided more value than the location/hours information (realized this information is easily found on restaurants’ Google Business pages, so no need to highlight them on the homepage)</li>
                        <li>In addition to providing more usability, it shows off related imagery, which gives users a better sense of the restaurant experience</li>

                        <li>Syncing with the image slideshow reduces cognitive load since users don’t have to scroll back and forth to compare items or images</li>

            <h4 class="h4-headers">CONCLUSION + LESSIONS LEARNED</h4>
            <h3>Opportunities for improvement</h3>
            <p class="p1-padding">
                As my first UX project I think it went pretty well. Moreover, I’m appreciative to have been able to experience the full UX design process. This has solidified my decision to continue down this career path. 
            </p>

            <h4>Success metrics</h4>
            <p>
                Due this being an unpublished project, we weren't able to collect any actual metrics, but if we could, these are the ones we would focus on:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><span>Task Success Rate:</span> Keeping track of the percentage of users who complete certain tasks directly shows if a design helps users with their goals</li>
                <li><span>User Satisfaction:</span> Using post-task surveys or usability scale ratings (SUS) allows you to truely know if a user found your design enjoyable, just because a user completes a task quickly doesn't mean they're not frustrated</li>
                <li><span>Behavioral Metrics (Clickmaps):</span> Looking at what users are clicking/ignoring sheds light on whether information hierarchy/layout is working as intended</li>
                <li><span>Path Analysis:</span> Viewing users’ pathing helps us understand whether or not they're getting lost/confused while navigating the app</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Lessons learned</h4>
            <ol>
                <li><span>Feedback is so important.</span> After going through this entire project, I've really come to understand design blindness and confirmation bias. These things are detrimental to the design process and are real problems. Making sure I get feedback from my peers and instructor throughout this project really helped prevent these and opened my eyes to things I missed.</li>
                <li><span>Make sure to start with a strong foundation.</span> One big mistake my team and I made was rushing our design process too much. I think we should’ve explored more options at the beginning and iterated more. Additionally, I should have fleshed out our style guide more thoroughly to prevent design discrepancies when we each worked our parts.</li>
                <li><span>Switch between macro and micro thinking.</span> As an emerging designer, this is one of the most important things I need to keep in mind. When designing, I need to make sure to take a step back and ask myself if what I’ve made so far aligns with the brand/client’s wider message. Is it scalable? Will this design work across mobile, print, or social media? Depending on the product, these are essential questions that I should be considering throughout the entire design process.</li>
