                <h2>Pacific Garbage Patch Poster</h2>
                
                <p>
                    This graphic was for a design class I was taking where we had to make a poster focusing 
                    on a major historical event. Initially, my topic was Watergate/Nixon, but I found this 
                    topic dull, so I switched to the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. Finally, after a couple of 
                    iterations, I ended up with this.

                <h2>UFO Movie Poster</h2>
                
                <p>
                    For a class focused on design, I created this graphic. For this one, I had to make a 
                    poster utilizing a custom font that my class and I produced earlier in the semester. 
                    Moreover, I could only use two colors: yellow and light blue. Here, I used varying 
                    opacities to get the green you see.

                <h2>Research Post Design</h2>
                
                <p>
                    I made this graphic for one of the weekly meeting announcements for the RIT UX club. 
                    I just really liked how it turned out with the repetition and contrast.

                <h2>Typography Post Design</h2>
                
                <p>
                    This was another graphic I made for one of the weekly meeting announcements for the RIT UX club. 
                    It was a meeting about the basics of typography, so I decided to show this by highlighting 
                    the different parts of a font within the design.
