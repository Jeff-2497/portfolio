                    <h3>An Overview</h3>
                    <p>
                        With so many small businesses relying on outdated websites, me and some other members in the UX Club 
                        wanted to challenge ourselves with a real-world redesign opportunity. We found a website that belonged 
                        to a local Rochester ice cream shop that had <span class="emphasize">great personality
                        </span> but <span class="emphasize">lacked the usability, accessibility, and structure </span>
                        users and customers would expect. Although this wasn’t a paid project, we saw it as a good 
                        opportunity to practice user-centered design in a real context.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        With the goal of utilizing collaborative research, ideation, and prototyping, our team aimed to 
                        <span class="emphasize">create a high-fidelity prototype</span>  for a redesigned website that <span class="emphasize">enhanced the clarity, navigation, and mobile responsiveness </span>
                        of the original site. This would thus help users find what they need quickly while preserving the shop’s local 
                        charm and friendly identity.
                    </p>

            <h3>Outdated design and poor usability on local small business websites</h3>
            <p class="p1-padding">
                Many small businesses rely on outdated or poorly structured websites that fail to meet modern usability 
                and accessibility standards. So even when a site is full of personality, the lack of clarity, navigation, 
                and mobile responsiveness will turn off many potential customers.

            <h3>Continuing the project solo after initial team collaboration</h3>
            <p class="p1-padding">
                Due members' reduced involvement in the UX Club and having limited availability, this project fell through
                and was discontinued towards the middle of spring 2025. However, I still think there's potential to create a
                user-centered redesign for Yolickity, and I plan to continue this project in the forseeable future.
            </p>   

            <h4>Moving forward</h4>
            <p>
                Since this project remains incomplete, outlined below are the main steps I'll take to finalize and refine this redesign:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li><span>Revisit User Research:</span> Review existing survey questions and send out a revised user survey to discover common pain points and positive experiences</li>
                <li><span>Refine Site Architecture:</span> Simplify and reorganize the website’s structure to improve navigation, clarity, and overall user flow.</li>
                <li><span>Create User Flows:</span> Map out the paths users take to complete key tasks on the website, making sure the navigation and interactions are clear and efficient.</li>
                <li><span>Design Wireframes:</span> Create wireframes relfecting the new site architecture and information gleaned from the previous user research and flows</li>
                <li><span>Develop High-Fidelity Prototype:</span> Build an interactive prototype that visually represents the final redesign direction.</li>
                <li><span>Preform User Testing:</span> Conduct usability tests to ensure no missed pain points, to validate the design direction, and that the final product meets user expectations.</li>
            </ol>
