                    <h3>An Overview</h3>
                    <p>
                        This was a light redesign project I undertook for a local coffee shop up in Rochester, New York. 
                        The focus was on updating their logo to better reflect their identity. I explored several 
                        creative directions through sketching and then digital iterations before arriving at a clean, 
                        nature-inspired design. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This final iteration aimed to strike a balance between professionalism 
                        and a friendly, community-focused feeling.

                <h2>Initial Sketches</h2>
                
                <p>
                    Here, after creating a mind map, I just got as many ideas down as possible. These encompassed 
                    some font-centric as well as icon-based logos. I also experimented with sketching physical 
                    objects to uncover any unexpected design directions/inspiration.

                <h2>Logo/Font Iterations</h2>
                
                <p>
                    I took some of the sketches and created digital iterations of them on Adobe Illustrator. I focused 
                    on a font-centric design, shaping text to fill specific forms, and a design incorporating tree roots. 
                    I also experimented with various typefaces to see which ones fit the brand's tone and aesthetic.

                <h2>Finalized Logo</h2>
                
                <p>
                    In the end, I decided to go with my font-centric design. This was due to its simple, but representative 
                    nature, allowing it to be easily recognizable from a distance as well as still being engaging up close. 
                    After a couple of tweaks, I ended up with these three variations.

                <h2>Business Card</h2>
                
                <p>
                    For this business card design, I used one of my logo iterations for the back, extending its baseline to add 
                    more balance and better utilize the whitespace. I then just added a brown background to better convey the 
                    tree/nature vibe of the brand. On the front, I reused the root graphic from one of my unused logo ideas, 
                    applying a low opacity so as not to distract from the important contact information.

                <h2>Letterhead</h2>
                
                <p>
                    With the letterhead, I used a typical letterhead format with the main information in the top right corner and 
                    the logo in the top left. To make it unique, I created a brown bar at the bottom to resemble dirt, and I 
                    included the logo's "T" emerging from it. This detail maintains the logo's tree symbolism and strengthens 
                    the consistency of the brand aesthetic.

                <h2>Menu</h2>
                
                <p>
                    Finally, for the menu, I continued using the brown featured in the other brand materials, but instead of white, 
                    I paired it with a cream color. I wanted it to give off a more warm/inviting feeling since it would be something 
                    customers would interact with frequently. Other than that, I used a similar font to what Tree Town Cafe was 
                    already using for the headers to maintain familiarity, and also incorporated a half-stump graphic into the drink 
                    side of the menu to further reinforce the theme.
